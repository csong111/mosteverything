Someone has given you a function called map
You don't know what it does, but there are clues at the bottom of this file
Use these clues to describe what map is.
Specifically:
 - How many parameters does it have
1
 - What are the types of the parameters
array
 - What does it do?
uses function double to double the elements of an array if its elements are Numbers
uses function triple to triple the elements of an array if its elements are Numbers
uses function to UpperCase to capitalize the elements of an array if its elements are strings
uses function to LowerCase to put into small caps, the elements of an array if its elements are strings

var someNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var someStrings = ["bob", "ERIC"];

function toUpperCase(x) {
    return x.toUpperCase();
}

function toLowerCase(x) {
    return x.toLowerCase();
}

function double(x) {
    return x * 2;
}

function triple(x) {
    return x * 3;
}

map(someNumbers, double) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
map(someNumbers, triple) => [3, 6, 9, 12]

map(someStrings, toUpperCase) => ["BOB", "ERIC"]
map(someStrings, toLowerCase) => ["bob", "eric"]
